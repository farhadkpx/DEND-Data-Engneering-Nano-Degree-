# Project: Sparkify Data Lake
### `Project Introduction`
An imaginary and data-simulated music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to an online data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, we are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

> We'll be able to test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to us by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## `Project in Description`
In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, we will need to load data from S3, transforms them(data) into five different tables using Py-Spark and write them back as partitioned-table into a parquet files in the directories on S3. We'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.  Each table has its own folder within the directory. 

> Songs table files are partitioned by year and then artist. Time table files are partitioned by year and month. Songplays table files are partitioned by year and month.


## `Project Datasets`
We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

+ Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
+ Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

**`Song Dataset:`** The song dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

+ song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
+ song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

**`Log Dataset:`**
The log dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

+ log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json

+ log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

## `Justify database Star Schema:`
Using the song_data and log_datasets, we'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This break down comprises 1-Fact-table and 4-dimension tables. The data type schema of all the tables are kept unchanged from the given two data files. I only made a diverging change with the "ts/start_time" column from log_data file. I transformed "ts/start_time" column into six different columns with new "time_table". This dis-integration is designed to help us analyze our time-data into a more segmented form.

`A snap of the ts-column transformation with two UDF`

*explain:*
get_timestamp = udf(lambda x: x/1000, TimestampType())

log_df = log_df.withColumn("TimeStamp", get_timestamp(log_df.ts))

*explain:*
get_datetime = udf(lambda x: datetime.fromtimestamp(x), TimestampType())

log_df = log_df.withColumn("start_time", get_datetime(log_df.TimeStamp))
    
After these "UDF" transformations we break down "ts" column into start_time(TIMESTAMP) , hour(INT), day(INT), week(INT), month(INT), year(INT), weekday(STRING) column. Besides these schematic change all the other columns in five tables stayed the same as they came with.

### Fact Table
`1.` **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong with columns ( songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent )

### Dimension Tables
`2.` **users** - users in the app with columns ( user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level )

`3.` **songs** - songs in music database with columns ( song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration )

`4.` **artists** - artists in music database columns ( artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude )

`5.` **time** - start_time columns from songplays broken down into specific units (start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday(string))

### `Project Template Files:`
If we want to use given the project template which comes along with the classroom then we can work on our project with a smaller dataset found in the workspace, and then move on to the bigger dataset on AWS. Alternatively, you can download the template files in the Resources tab in the classroom and work on this project on your local computer.

The project template includes three files:

+ **etl.py** -  reads data from S3, transforms data using Spark, and writes them back to S3

+ **dl.cfg** -  contains your AWS credentials

+ **README.md provides** - discussion on your process and decisions


## How to run python-script files
To run this project in local mode, create a file dl.cfg in the root of this project with the following data:

KEY = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"

SECRET = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"

Create an S3 Bucket named sparkify-dend where output results will be stored.

Finally, run the following command:

python etl.py

## ETL Pipeline Steps:

- Load the credentials from dl.cfg
- Load the Data which are in JSON Files(Song Data and Log Data)
- After loading the JSON Files from S3 use Spark processes to generate a set of Fact and Dimension Tables
- Load these partitioned parquet files back to S3 ready for analysis
