# Project: Sparkify Data Lake
### `Introduction`
An imaginary, data-simulated music streaming startup, `Sparkify`, has grown their user base and song database even more and they want to move their data warehouse to an online data lake. Their data resides in an Amazon `S3` bucket as JSON files on `user activity on the music app`, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their `data engineer`, we are tasked with `building an ETL pipeline` that `extracts their data from S3 bucket`, `processes them using PySpark`, and `loads the transformed data back into S3` as a set of 4-dimensional tables and 1-fact table. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to, how and when they listening to.

> Our transformational database and ETL pipeline should withstand test run by the data analytics team from `SPARKIFY`. The analytics team should be able to run queries against these tables to compare our results with their expected analytical results.


## `Project Description`
In this project, we'll apply what we've learned with PySpark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on `S3`. To complete the project, we will need to `load data from S3 bucket`, `transforms them(data)` into five different tables using `Py-Spark` and write them back as `partitioned-table` into a parquet files in the directories on `S3`. Each table has its own folder within the directory. 

> `songs_table` file is `partitioned by` `year` and then `artist_id/artist`. `time_table` and `songplays_table` files are `partitioned by` `year and month` and send them back to S3 bucket as a parquet file. There were no partition done with `artist_table` and `users_table`.

## `Project Datasets`
We'll be working with two datasets that reside in Amazon S3 bucket owned by 'udacity'. Here are the S3 links for each:

+ `Song data:` `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
+ `Log data:` `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

**`Song Dataset:`** The song dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

**`Log Dataset:`**
The log dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. 


## `Database Star Schema Design:`
Using the song_data and log_datasets, we'll need to create a **star-schema** optimized for queries on users songplays analysis. The `star-schema` is used as a data model with this ETL-pipeline. This break down comprises 1-Fact-table and 4-dimension tables. The data-type-schema of all the tables are kept unchanged from the given two data tables with some reinforcement. This model design will enable us to query the database schema with fewer SQL-Query joins and quick database accessibility.

`Transformation:` I only made a diverging change with the **ts/start_time"** column from log_data file. It transformed "ts/start_time" column into six different columns with new "time" table. This dis-integration is designed to help us analyze our time-data into a more segmented form. This form of break down is very critical in data anaysis of time data. After the `ts-column` transformations we break down "ts" column into `start_time(TIMESTAMP) , hour(INT), day(INT), week(INT), month(INT), year(INT), weekday(STRING)` columns. Besides these schematic change all the other columns in five tables stayed the same as they came with.

Here is the ER-Diagram with fact-table **songplays** truly represents the *4-dimensional tables* ( **users, songs, artists and time tables** ) with `foreign/primary key` in its design. So we didn't need any other transformation on those representative key columns.

> ### `Fact Table`
`1.` **songplays** - records in log data in associated with song_data where user's songplay records matches with page `NextSong` with columns ( `songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent` )

> ### `Dimension Tables`
`2.` **users** - users in the app with columns ( `user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level` )

`3.` **songs** - songs in music database with columns ( `song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration` )

`4.` **artists** - artists in music database columns ( `artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude` )

`5.` **time** - start_time columns from songplays broken down into specific units ( `start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday(string)`)


## `Project Template Files:`
If we want to use given project template which comes along with the `classroom-workspace` then we can work on our project with a smaller dataset found in the workspace, and then move on to the bigger dataset on AWS. Alternatively, we can download the template files from the `Resources tab` in the classroom and work on those data-tables in our local computer.

The project template includes three files with click in link available to the right:

+ **`etl.py`** -  reads data from S3, transforms data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.[[link]]( )

+ **`dl.cfg`** -  contains your AWS credentials.[[link]]( )

+ **`README.md provides`** - discussion on your process and decisions.[[link]]()


## `How to run python-script files`
We can run **etl.py** script file in our local machine or on the `Classroom-Workspace` cloud. We need to fill in the **dl.cfg** file in the root of this project with the following AWS-access keys. 

**KEY = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY** ( This is our/your  `USER` AWS access key )

**SECRET = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY** ( `USER` AWS secret key )

In addition, we need to create a SPARK session within the 'python-environment' to run the `Py-Spark` script. We also need to create a `S3 Bucket` named `"udacity-dend/sparkify/"`, where output results will be stored. Finally, run the following command on class room workspace command line interface with `python etl.py`.


## `ETL Pipeline Steps:`
The ETL pipeline comprises with all the consolidated steps we've developed so far to run the data transformation. In sequence `Extracting data from S3`, `transforming them as needed with Py-SPARK` and `loading them back to S3 as partitioned-parquet file` all in a automated processeses. The sequence can be addrssed as follows:

`1.` Obtaining the credentials from dl.cfg file.

`2.` Loading the Data-files which are in JSON format files(Song Data and Log Data).

`3.` Transforming these files with pySpark to generate a set of Fact and Dimension Tables.

`4.` Loading these files back to S3 as partitioned parquet files ready for data analysis. 

## `Sending files(time constrian)`
I did send my 5 parquet files back to workspace a folder name `Results` with five separate folder names `(songs, artists, users, time, songplays)` instead of sending them back to a Amazon S3 bucket due to time constraint. It takes extraordinary time to send those parquet files back to Amazon S3 bucket. But for clarity I kept codes available for use in my `etl.py` script.

### `README guideline:`
Here is an example query I did run on songplays table. It is about in average how many hours a user spent on listening songs on the app.
