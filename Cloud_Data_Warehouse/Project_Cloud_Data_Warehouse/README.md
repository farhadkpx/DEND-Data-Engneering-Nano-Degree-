## Project: Cloud Data Warehouse
### `Project Description`
Sparkify, a music streaming startup has grown their user base and song database and want to move their data processing onto the cloud. Their data resides in Amazon S3 bucket, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Amazon-Redshift. As their data engineer, we’re tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts song-data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of fact and dimensional tables. 

This transformation will help  Sparkify’s analytical team to test the database and ETL pipeline by running analytical queries. The analytics team should be able to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to and also able to compare our database performance with their expected results.

## `Project Datasets`
We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

**Song data:** `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`

**Log data:** `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

**Log data json path:** `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

### `Song Dataset`
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json` and `song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

### `Log Dataset`
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json` and `log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`


> ## `Database schema design`
We'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on user song-playing behavior. The star schema will contain a fact-table(songplays) and 4-dimension tables( users, songs, artists, time tables ). The main source of data will come from log and song dataset. We'll create multiple table join and extraction of columns from these two tables to form all the necessary tables for this project.

### `Staging Tables:`
Sourced from Amazon S3 bucket without any data type or schematic change.

`1.` `staging_events:` contains all the fields and rows from the logs.jsons dataset. 

`2.` `staging_songs:` contains all the fields and rows from the songs.jsons dataset. 

During the design processes I didn't make any `data-type` change on the selected columns except some break-down of 'timestamp' column into 6 separate columns. The `timestamp` column is manipulated into multiple columns which deems very necessary for data analysis.

### `Fact Table`
`1.` `songplays` - ( records in event/log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong ) [ `songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent` ]

### `Dimension Tables:`
`2.` `users` - ( user detail in the app ) [ `user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level` ]

`3.` `songs` - ( song detail in music database ) [ `song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration` ]

`4.` `artists` - ( artists detail in music database ) [ `artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude` ]

`5.` `time` - ( timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units ) [ `start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday` ]


> ## `Project Template Files:` 
Project template includes five files to work with this project available on project workspace. All these files are posted in my github repository with this [[`github link`](https://github.com/farhadkpx/DEND-Data-Engneering-Nano-Degree-/tree/main/Cloud_Data_Warehouse/Project_Cloud_Data_Warehouse)]

`1.` `dwh.cfg` file contains all the necessary AWS credentials and database sourcing information. Due to `security-related-issues` some of the details will not be added into the github repository.[[`dwh.cfg file link`](https://github.com/farhadkpx/DEND-Data-Engneering-Nano-Degree-/blob/main/Cloud_Data_Warehouse/Project_Cloud_Data_Warehouse/dwh.cfg.txt)]

`2.` `sql_queries.py` define and design schemas for your staging, fact and dimension tables for this project.[[`sql_queries.py link`](https://github.com/farhadkpx/DEND-Data-Engneering-Nano-Degree-/blob/main/Cloud_Data_Warehouse/Project_Cloud_Data_Warehouse/sql_queries.py)]

`3.` `create_tables.py` implements the logic created in sql_queries.py file to build fact and dimension table on Redshift.[[`create_tables.py link`](https://github.com/farhadkpx/DEND-Data-Engneering-Nano-Degree-/blob/main/Cloud_Data_Warehouse/Project_Cloud_Data_Warehouse/create_tables.py)

`4.` `etl.py` is where we'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then insert those data into our newly created tables on Redshift.[[`etl.py link`](https://github.com/farhadkpx/DEND-Data-Engneering-Nano-Degree-/blob/main/Cloud_Data_Warehouse/Project_Cloud_Data_Warehouse/etl.py)]

`5.` `README.md` file where we'll provide discussion in detail about programming processes and decisions for this ETL pipeline.


> ## `Project implementation Steps:`
To get started with the project we can work on it in the workspace on the classroom. Alternatively, we can download the template files from the “Resources tab” in the classroom and work on this project in our local computer. Files given with `resource-tab/workspace` with brief description here.

`1.`  `dwh.cfg` file in which we'll input Redshift-Cluster inoformation, `IAM-ROLE` detail and `S3-source` information, which connects to various aspect of AWS infrastructure to ensure that the pipeline should run effectively.

`2.` `sql_queries.py` script, where we'll define all the needed dropping, creating, inserting SQL statements and listings of codes all of which will be imported into `create_table.py` and `etl.py` script files as needed.

`3.` `create_table.py` file where we'll loop through `drop_table_queries` list to drop tables at the beginning, if the tables already exist. This way, we can run `create_table` function whenever we want to reset your database and test our ETL pipeline. The `create_table` function will implement fact and dimension tables design with the star-schema in Redshift.

`4.` `etl.py file` where we'll load data from Amazon S3 bucket into staging tables on Redshift using `copy_table_queries` list and then insert those data into the newly created tables using `insert_table_queries` list on to tables on Redshift, which is the final process of data pipeline creation.


> ## `Building ETL Pipeline(design)`
The pipeline works by querying the staging log and songs tables to extract the necessary data-informations that will populate the start-schema tables. In summary these pipeline steps are.

`1.` Implement the logic in `sql_queries.py` the main brick-mortar design block the project databse.

`2.` Test by running `create_tables.py`  file first then the `etl.py` second. Both have to run in the terminal without any errors. A successful run will make the whole data pipeline in effect.

`3.` In fact ‘etl.py’ script connects to the Sparkify redshift database, loads log_data and song_data into staging tables, and transforms them into the five (star-schema) tables.

### `Example Query in effect:`
A quick view of two query resulted from the effective data pipeline design for this project.

`First.` **Most listened song title and artist name and number of times a song was listened by the users.**

`Second.` **User first_name, last_name and number of song they listened.**

These views of queries are just to show, how we can use `AWS Redshift` for more efficient analytical purposes. Any silly mistakes, sorry. It's too much writing to do with. Hopefully it helps to visualize Sparkify database creation.
