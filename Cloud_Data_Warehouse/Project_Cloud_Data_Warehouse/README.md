## Project: Data Warehouse
### `Introduction`
Sparkify, a music streaming startup has grown their user base and song database and want to move their data processes onto the cloud. Their data resides in Amazon S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
As their data engineer, we’re tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. 
We should be able to test the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to us by the analytics team from Sparkify. The analytics team should be able to compare our results with their expected results.

### `Project Description`
In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, we will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## `Project Datasets`
We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json




### `Song Dataset`
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### `Log Dataset`
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

## `Justify your database schema design`
Using the song and event datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.
I processed the info contained in the S3 bucket into staging tables that I later used to create the main database.

### `Staging Tables`
staging_events: contains all the fields and rows from the logs jsons.
staging_songs: contains all the fields and rows from the songs jsons.
Using the songs and events staging tables, I created a star schema database optimized for queries on song play analysis, which is composed of the following tables.

### `Fact Table`
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### `Dimension Tables`
users - users in the app
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
artists - artists in music database
artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## `Project Template Files:` 
Project Template includes five files to work with this project.
1. dwh.cfg file contains all the necessary AWS credentials and database sourcing information.
2. sql_queries.py define and design and schemas for your staging, fact and dimension tables with SQL CREATE statements for this project.
3. create_tables.py implements the logic created in sql_queries.py file to build fact and dimension table on Redshift.
4. etl.py is where we'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then insert those data into our newly created tables on Redshift.
5. README.md is where we'll provide discussion on our data and file processes and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

## `Project implementation Steps:`
To get started with the project we can do it on the workspace in the classroom. Alternatively, we can download the template files from the “Resources tab” in the classroom and work on this project in our local computer. 
Files given with resource-tab/workspace with brief description here.
1. dwh.cfg file contains all the necessary credentials and file sourcing information, which connects to various aspect of AWS infrastructure to ensure that the pipeline should run effectively.
2. sql_queries.py script, where we'll define all the needed dropping, creating, inserting SQL statements and 4-listings of codes all of which will be imported into two other script files as needed.
3. create_table.py file where we'll call “drop_table_queries” and “create_table_queries” list to implement fact and dimension tables design for the star-schema in Redshift.
Write SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist. This way, you can run create_tables.py whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.

4. etl.py file where we'll load data from Amazon S3 bucket into staging tables on Redshift using “copy_table_queries” list and then insert those data into the newly created tables using “insert_table_queries” list on to tables on Redshift.


## `Build ETL Pipeline(State and justify your ETL pipeline design)`
To run this project you will need to fill the dwh.cfg file with your Amazon Redshift cluster credentials. The pipeline works by querying the staging tables to extract the necessary informations that will populate the final tables. To execute the pipeline you just need to create the database by using the terminal running the command:

python create_tables.py
And then trigger the pipeline execution, still on the terminal, with:

Now that the pipeline executed successfully you can write another file containing your queries or work directly in the AWS web interface.
1. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
4. Delete your redshift cluster when finished.

### `Document Process`
Do the following steps in your README.md file.
1. Discuss the purpose of this database in context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
2. State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
3. [Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
